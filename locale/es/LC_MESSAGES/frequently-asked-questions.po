"**What is Ethereum?** Ethereum is a decentralized smart contracts "
"platform that is powered by a cryptocurrency called Ether. A good "
"starting point to learn more about it's workings would be the `Wiki "
"<https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/What-is-Ethereum>`_."

"**I have heard of Ethereum, but what are Geth, Mist, Ethminer, Mix, and "
"AlethOne?** As you already know, Ethereum is the blockchain-based smart "
"contract platform that this Wiki describes. Akin to Bitcoin, Ethereum "
"needs miners to solve cryptographic puzzles to confirm transactions and "
"bring cryptocurrency into existence, nodes to witness and record any "
"transactions/computations made and 'wallets' to initiate "
"transactions/computations."

"**Mist**: This is the equivalent of a web browser, but for the Ethereum "
"platform. It acts as a GUI to display the accounts and contracts that you"
" have or use on the Ethereum blockchain. It also allows you to create and"
" interact with contracts in a graphical user interface without ever "
"touching the command line. If you are not a developer and just want to "
"store Ether and interact with Ethereum contracts, then Mist is the "
"program to use. Latest releases can be found `here "
"<https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases>`_."
