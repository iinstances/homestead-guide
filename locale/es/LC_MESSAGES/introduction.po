"A cryptographic function which takes an input (or 'message') and returns "

"In addition to developing the software for Ethereum, the ability to "
"launch a new cryptocurrency and blockchain requires a massive "
"bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it "
"up and running. To kickstart a large network of developers, miners, "
"investors, and other stakeholders, Ethereum announced its plan to conduct"
" a presale of ether tokens, the currency unit of Ethereum. The legal and "
"financial complexities of raising funds through a presale led to the "
"creation of several legal entities, including the Ethereum Foundation "
"(Stiftung Ethereum) established June 2014 in Zug, Switzerland."

"The Ethereum platform itself is featureless or value-agnostic. Similar to"
" programming languages, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to "
"decide what it should be used for. However, it is clear that certain "
"application types benefit more than others from Ethereum's capabilities. "
"Specifically, ethereum is **suited for applications that automate direct "
"interaction between peers or facilitate coordinated group action across a"
" network**. For instance, applications for coordinating peer-to-peer "
"marketplaces, or the automation of complex financial contracts. Bitcoin "
"allows for individuals to exchange cash without involving any middlemen "

" be more far-reaching. In theory, financial interactions or exchanges of "
"any complexity could be carried out automatically and reliably using code"

"where trust, security, and permanence are important – for instance, "
"asset-registries, voting, governance, and the internet of things – could "
